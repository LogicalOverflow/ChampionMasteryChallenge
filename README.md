# MasterStats

MasterStats is a web application providing statistical data on champion
mastery. It provides highest grades and champion level distributions
for summoners and champions. Champions additionally have a mastery score
and a player region distribution as well as the highest mastery score known.
For summoners the top champions without chests, the top champions overall,
the sum of all champion mastery scores as well as a distribution of chests
granted and champions played are also provided.

This project runs on a tomcat (Version 8.0.33) server using the wicket framework
for the web interface and storing the data in an AWS DynamoDB. Maven is used as build
system. The live demo is deployed using AWS Beanstalk. A running demo can be found at
http://masterstats-default.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/.

# Getting your own Instance
First of all you need to create the 5 DynamoDB tables:
* champion
  * primary key (read capacity: 1, write capacity: 1):
    * partition key: keyName (string)
    * sort key: championId (number)
* championMastery
  * primary key (read capacity: 10, write capacity: 10):
    * partition key: summonerKey (string)
    * sort key: championId (number)
  * championPoints-chestGranted-index (read capacity: 1, write capacity: 10):
    * partition key: championPoints (number)
    * sort key: chestGranted (number)
* championStatistic
  * primary key (read capacity: 1, write capacity: 1):
    * partition key: keyName (string)
    * sort key: championId (number)
* summoner
  * primary key (read capacity: 5, write capacity: 1):
    * partition key: summonerKey (string)
    * sort key: summonerName (string)
  * division-tier-index (read capacity: 1, write capacity: 1):
    * partition key: division (string)
    * sort key: tier (string)
  * masteryScore-lastUpdated-index (read capacity: 5, write capacity: 1):
    * partition key: masteryScore (number)
    * sort key: lastUpdated (number)
* summonerStatistic
  * primary key (read capacity: 1, write capacity: 1):
    * partition key: summonerKey (string)
    * sort key: summonerName (string)

When you want to use other table/index names and/or capacities you must also
update the DBTable enum (Db package) and the matching DataClass (Db package)
accordingly.

Next, you must create 2 properties files in the folder src/main/resources:
* api.properties: must contain the following properties:
  * apiKey: your API key
  * devKey: true, if you use a development key, false if you use a
  production key (used to configure the rate limits). If the option has
  an invalid value or is not set at all, false is used.
* dynamoDB.properties: must contain the following properties:
  * accessKey: the access key for a IAM user with access to the database
  * secretKey: the secret key for a IAM user with access to the database
  * region: the region the dynamoDB is hosted (e.g. "EU_CENTRAL_1")

Now you can build the MasterStats-Server.war file using maven. The war file
can then be deployed to your tomcat server.

As new summoners are collected using the existing summoners in the database,
you will have to add some from each region by hand to the database. The easiest
way to do this is to just search for them on your instance.

# Technologies used

I use [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) and [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) mainly because I already have experience
using them. [AWS Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) is used for deployment of the live demo and was
very easy to use, as I just needed to upload my war file to have my
application running.

[Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) is the graphing library I have chosen because it allows me to generate the graphs from the Java code without touching any CSS or HTML. And [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used
as it makes it easy to create good-looking websites.

[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) and [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/) are used as they made my life much easier with their
convenient annotations and functions.

[Slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) and [Log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j) are used for logging, just because I already had some experience using them.

# Code Documentation and Comments

The whole code (except some simple data classes) is commented for easier reading
and understanding, so if you want to know how anything works, just look at
the code. If any questions crop up, feel free to contact me so I can clarify
the comments.

# Challenges

### Storing the data
While working on the project, one of the challenges I encountered, was how to store
all of my data. My first try was to use a MySQL database. It worked well at first,
but when I reached around 100000 summoners, the database got really slow. So I
decided to go for DynamoDB, as I used it a little bit already while looking around
the AWS Management Console. I created my tables and transferred all the data from
the MySQL to DynamoDB using some Java code. While transferring I updated my code to
use annotated data classes for the DynamoDB items and a mapper to access the
database. Additionally, I reworked all my functions (statistic generation, adding
summoners, etc.) to be able to use DynamoDB.

When I used MySQL I just used aggregate functions to generate my statistics. With
DynamoDB I needed to take a different approach, as there are no aggregate functions.
I started scanning the whole database and collection the data while scanning. As this
process is very read intensive for the database, I decided to store the generated
statistics in the database as well and only generate them once a day in the middle of
the night using schedulers.

### Collecting the summoners
The challenge of finding new summoners came up because there is no way of getting
random summoners using Riot's API directly. I first started checking random summoner
ids on all regions, always generating 10 random ids and then requesting the summoner
information from the API for each region. This actually worked better than I had expected
and after a few days I had more than 40000 summoners from 6 regions (TR, KR, EUNE,
EUW, NA, BR) in my database. Then I decided to change things up because the summoners I
was collecting were partially not active and I needed a lot of requests for a few summoners.

My new and current method is, to get a batch of summoners from the database and then request
their match histories. After that all summoner from their last games played are added to the
database as well. If a summoner has no games in their history, they will be deleted form the
database as they are not actively playing.

### Keeping my credentials save
As all the code must be published on GitHub, hardcoding the API key and my AWS credentials
didn't sound like a great idea. I looked for an easy and clean way to keep my API key
and my AWS credentials save without storing them in system variables because I want to be
easily able to switch the server hosting my page. Additionally, making it easy to set them
for other people, was important for me as well, as I want other people to easily set
up their own instance of my code.

After thinking about the problem for a while, I decided to put the information, I want to
keep save, in properties files. On the one hand, they are easily accessible from the code
as I added classes (AWSPropertiesProvider and RiotApiFactory) to read the properties from
the file and provide them to the application where needed. On the other hand, they are easily
accessible from outside, without a need to recompile anything, and can be excluded from GitHub
without any problems. I also decided to move the AWS Region to this properties file
as it is more easily accessible in contrast to a hardcoded region and an option one might want to change.

### Visualizing the data
Even though I had my statistics, just printing them out as text does not look nice and makes it
hard to look at and draw any conclusions. That is why I needed a way to make nice graphs using
my data. I first tried [chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), but even though the library seems to be nice, getting the data
from the Java code to the charts, styling and configuring was not something done well.
So I started looking for alternatives and found [Wicked Charts](https://github.com/thombergs/wicked-charts), a wrapper for the JavaScript library
[Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/). Using it, I was able to completely configure the charts using Java and create charts,
looking the way I wanted them to.


### Respecting Rate Limits
As both the Riot API as well as the reads and writes to DynamoDB are limited I had to ensure I do not
run too many requests parallel. After some research I found Guavas RateLimiter, which does exactly
what I need. I created an instance per API region and two per database table (read and write) and
whenever an API request is send, the rate limiters acquire is called to wait for available capacity.
The same happens for every read and write to DynamoDB.
