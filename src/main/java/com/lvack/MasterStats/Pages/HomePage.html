                    All area charts are zoomable, just drag and drop over the rectangle you want to zoom in on.</P>
                <p> All data was collected using <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot's API</a>. The
                    project's source code together with documentation is freely available on
                    <a href="https://github.com/LogicalOverflow/ChampionMasteryChallenge">GitHub</a> and the statistics
                    are updated nightly around <span wicket:id="update_time"></span>.</p>
